## notice
This project is no longer used by me. If you have an issue, I will try to fix it for you.

Known bugs include a bug where text on the loading screen cannot be resized. This is present with certain themes. I could not figure out how to fix it.

I recommend using [sbctl](https://github.com/Foxboron/sbctl), and I personally now use rEFInd.

This project is not _dead_, but will no longer be updated aside from bugfixes.
